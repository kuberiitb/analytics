##code

I have added two basic R codes to pull data of Indian General election 2014 from election commission official website eciresults.nic.in       
First one is statewise.R, which is state/UTwise summarized data for winners and runner-ups       
Second one is const_wise.R, which can be called raw data, as it is constituencywise data for every candidate.      

Respective data(./data/state_wise_election_result_2014.csv and  ./data/const_wise_election_result_2014.csv) is also attached, along with codes and one example of graphical representation is also attached in out folder.   


Enjoy Analyzing!!
